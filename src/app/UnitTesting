are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. 
This testing methodology is done during the development process by the software developers

There are basically 3 types of tests:
Unit, Integration, End-to-end

Unit Test: Here we test a component in isolation, without external resource(like file system, DB ,API end points)
[In angular it is component]

Integration Test: testing the component with external resources(like file system, DB ,API end points) 
[In angular it is component + template]

End-to-end  Test - test the application as a whole

describe() defines a test suite[it is a group of related tests]
it() defines a single test/spec
ex:
describr('a_name',()=>{
    it('a_test_name',()=>{
        
    })
})
